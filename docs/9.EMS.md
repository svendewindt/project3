## 9. Enterprise Mobility and Security

We still haven't covered assigning Office 365 licenses to end users. We could do that user per user, but we would rather have that done automatically. This feature is not available in our subscription. We need an Azure Active Directory Premium subscription for that.

Let's active the Enterprise Mobility and Security trial (EMS). This includes the required subscription. And while we're at it, let's assign the licenses based on a security group. The previous scripts created a suitable group `teamtile`.

Now whenever we create a new user, and make him/her a member of the security group `teamtile`, that user will get the correct licenses assigned.
